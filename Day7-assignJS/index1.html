            Assignment 2:
            Heath and Zane are both playing basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, Heath’s team scored 89, 120 and 103 points while Zane’s team scored 116. 94 and 123 points.
            1.	Calculate the average score for each team
            2.	Decide which team wins in average (highest average score) and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
            3.	Then change the scores to show different winners. Don’t forget to consider that there might be a draw (the same average score)
            4.	EXTRA: Mariah also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average value to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.
