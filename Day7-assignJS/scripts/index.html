            Assignment 1
            Jeff and Todd are trying to compare their BMI (body mass index) which is calculated using the formula-: BMI= mass(kg)/height(m)^2 = mass/(height*height)
            1.	Store Jeff and Todd’s height in variables
            2.	Calculate both their BMIs
            3.	Create a boolean variable containing information on whether Jeff has higher BMI than John
            4.	Print a string to console containing the variable from step 3 (Something like “is Jeff’s BMI higher than Todd’s true?”)
